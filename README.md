# IGLib Modules' Container Repository

This is the [IGLib modules' container repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules) used to clone and build the new IGLib modules (as opposed to the classical IGLib libraries, which are built by [this repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibcontainer)). See also the readme files of the [IGLibCore repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.modules.IGLibCore) and the basic [IGLib Framework repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib).

This repository is used for **cloning IGLib repositories** and for **developing and building** them locally. Cloning and updating the repositories is done using Windows batch scripts, while **other git** source control related tasks (such as branching, committing, pushing...) are performed by using normal Git clients such as Git command-line (git.exe) or TortoiseGit.
