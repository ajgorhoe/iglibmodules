# IGLib Modules' Container Repository

This is a container repository used to clone and build the new IGLib modules (as opposed to the classical IGLib libraries, which are build by [this repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibcontainer). See also the [IGLib repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib)).

## About IGLib Container Repository

This repository is used for **cloning IGLib repositories** and for **developing and building** them locally. Cloning and updating the repositories is done using Windows batch scripts, while **other git** source control related tasks (such as branching, committing, pushing...) are performed by using normal Git clients such as Git command-line (git.exe) or TortoiseGit.
