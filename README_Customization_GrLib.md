# Customizaion Branch `swrepos/GrLib/repoMain`

This branch contains customization of the `iglibmodules` repository for 3D graphics libraries and applications of my interest. I will use the repository at this branch to automate cloning and updating of these reposioried, prepare contributions and possibly customize some of these repositories to my needs. The GRLib `iglibmodules` repository seemed ideal as starting point for such a container repository because it seems to provide everything I need for my purpose.
