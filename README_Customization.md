[This branch (`swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib`)](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/tree/swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib) contains customization of the **[`iglibmodules` container repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules)** that serves as container of containers. It is used to **contain** and automate cloning and updating of **multiple repository containers**, each od which contains a set of software repositories and automates their cloning and updating. Container of software repository enables you to organize working clones of your software repository that you work on really easily.

## Use

## Easy Customization

It is easy to customize this branch and repository for your own purposes. If you need your own **container of containers**, just start from this branch (`swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib`) and adapt cloning / updating scripts for your own repository containers from the existing ones.

For your own **containers of software repositories**, you can take **[IOptLib's adaptation](https://github.com/IOptLib/iglibmodules)** on the **[branch `swrepos/GrLib/repoMain`](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/tree/swrepos/GrLib/repoMain)**.
