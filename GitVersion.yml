# Configuration file for the GitVersion tool.

# This is the original version of GitVersion.yml. It does not increment main
# version on every commit, increments minor version on dev branch after
# branching off main and adds `beta` suffix plus numbe r to versions on the
# develop branch, and versions other branches similarly.
# 
# * Commits on main produce versions like 1.2.3.
# * Commits on develop produce pre-releases like 1.3.0-beta.4.
# * You can tune increment rules per branch, or add feature/* branches to get 1.3.0-feature.mybranch.1.
