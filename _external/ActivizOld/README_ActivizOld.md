# `ActivizOld` - Updating Scripts for ActiViz Repositories Containing Old Sources or Binaries

* [IGLib Wiki: Visual Toolkit (VTK) and ActiViz - State and Comparison](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/wiki.IGLib/blob/main/IGLib/developmentareas/graphics3d/VtkComparison/VtkStateAndComparison.md#L4) (private repository) - this contains detailed information on VTK and ActiViz, with a rich set of links, including available old versions of ActiViz binaries and source code

The only available **Activiz source** code repository I have found is [dearman/activizdotnet](https://github.com/dearman/activizdotnet) ([my fork](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/activizdotnet)), but it is **not very useful**. The link provided in the readme file that should contain binaries does not work, but binaries are critical for ActiViz to work.

In the legacy IGLib Framework I use binaries that I have recorded long ago, and are included in the [IGLib base repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib) - see the [containing directory of the repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib/tree/master/externalextended) or [containing directory on a particular branch](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib/tree/feature/25_12_26_NumericRearrangement/externalextended) where the directory existed dor sure.
