# Some directories have multiple versions listed. Usually, only the first 
# version is actually checked out via the contained scrits, and other versions
# are listed such that one can manually make copies with suffices "1", "2" in
# order to perform some experimentation on different versions of the 
# repository. This also supprts having multiple versions where different
# commit, tag or branch is checked out, which is convenient for comparisons.
