# IGLib Modules' Container Repository

This is a container repository used to clone and build the new IGLib modules (as opposed to the classical IGLib libraries, which are build by [this repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibcontainer). See also the [IGLib repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.base.iglib)).
