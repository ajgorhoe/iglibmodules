# Customizaion Branch `swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib` - Container of Software Repository Containers

[This branch (`swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib`)](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/tree/swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib) contains customization of the **[`iglibmodules` container repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules)** that serves as container of containers. It is used to **contain** and automate cloning and updating of **multiple repository containers**, each od which contains a set of software repositories and automates their cloning and updating. Container of software repository enables you to organize working clones of your software repository that you work on really easily.

## Use

## Easy Customization

It is easy to customize this branch and repository for your own purposes. If you need your own **container of containers**, just start from this branch (`swrepos/RecursiveIGLib/mainRecursiveIGLib`) and adapt cloning / updating scripts for your own repository containers from the existing ones.

For your own **containers of software repositories**, you can take **[IOptLib's adaptation](https://github.com/IOptLib/iglibmodules)** on the **[branch `swrepos/GrLib/repoMain`](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/tree/swrepos/GrLib/repoMain)**. In particular, see the [Customization Readme]() for that customization branch and customization steps should be very clear.

Normally you can customize the container repository for your needs **within hours**, and the repository can be used on any platform where `PowerShell` can be installed (it is installed by default on Windows). The repository has a very small footprint and enables efficient cloning and updating of your repositories, groups of repositories and groups of groups of repositories.
