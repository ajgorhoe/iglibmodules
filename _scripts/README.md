# The _scripts/ directory (IGLib Modules' Container Repository)

This repository contains scripts for cloning/updating repositories of the *new* IGLib modules.

Scripts for legacy IGLib Framework's repositories are contained in the IGLibFramework/ subdirectory. Scripts for GitHub web pages are contained in the Web/ subdirectory.

Scripts for updating related groups of repositories are in the parent directory (repository root).

If you **customize** this repository for other software projects, and you replace or modify scripts in this directory, then update this README file on the customization branch (or several branches) with up-to-date information. See the [customization section](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/blob/main/README.md#customizing-the-repository-for-other-software-projects) of the repository README for more information.
