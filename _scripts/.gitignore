# REMARK
# Some directories have multiple versions listed (e.g. 
# iglibmodules_Recursive/, iglibmodules_Recursive1/, 
# iglibmodules_Recursive2/). Usually, only the first version is 
# actually checked out via the contained scripts, and other versions are
# listed such that one can manually make copies with suffices "1", "2" in
# order to perform some experimentation on different versions of the 
# repository. This also supprts having multiple versions where a different
# commit, tag or branch is checked out, which is convenient for comparisons.

# Standard, empty container of containers of repositories, baes on the
# iglibmodules container, branch .
# IGLibFramework repositorie:
/iglibmodules_Recursive
/iglibmodules_Recursive1
/iglibmodules_Recursive2
